# DeFi_Application

### Defi Application is a digital bank where you can earn interest positing crypto currencies..

## The problem DeFi Application solves
### In centralized applications the web browser calls to the front part of website and it access backend but it doesn't works in the system like banks and crypto wallets, because in this anyone who has the access to handle backend can steal your money, where in the DeFi app instead of accessing to backend servers website talks directly to the blockchain, blockchain contains the smart contracts and these smart contracts are immutable programs, so codes cannot be changed, and all the data stored in public ledger which is also immutable and when we add new data to blockchain it will be publically verifiable.

### You can fork if you waant to create your own digital bank and want to experiment with it 
### clone the repo into your local machine and just run the command...

## npm run start
